# BlackBoxLearning

This repo holds the simulation and analysis code for the Black Box learning project I wrote when working for Dr. Heinrich Nax in ETHZ Computational Social Science group. The simulations here were done to support Heinrichs experimental work on studing the behaviour of agents in a repeated game, where the agents had no information of the underlying sturcture of the game. For more information regarding the studies see the paper by H. Nax *et al* (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2016.04.006).
